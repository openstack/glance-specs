Pike Review Priorities
======================

Here are the Pike review priorities.  Due to the Pike cycle Glance personnel
situation, this list is reduced from what was published on the `PTG etherpad`_.
Thus in this cycle we're introducing a category of *untargeted* specs.  These
specs have been reviewed, approved, and are sufficiently detailed that they
could be implemented by new contributors, but given the current personnel
situation, we cannot realistically include them as priorities for the Pike
release.
