=======================================================
Add new cinder's attachment API and multiattach support
=======================================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/glance-store/+spec/attachment-api-and-multiattach-support

Make glance cinder store use cinder's new attachment APIs for image operations.

Problem description
===================

Currently when we make simultaneous requests to glance for using the image to
create multiple volumes or launch multiple instances, the same image volume needs
to be attached multiple times to serve the requests and since the support doesn't
exist in glance cinder store, some of the requests fails.

Proposed change
===============

Cinder's new attachment API was introduced in microversion 3.27 which should be
supported by cinder and is required to pass while making calls through cinderclient.
There were 2 new methods introduced, attachment_complete in MV 3.44 and passing
attach mode during attachment_create in MV 3.54 which are also required and hence
we will be using MV 3.54 for attachment related operations.
All these changes are required prior to adding the multiattach handling.

This should be a 2 stage change:

1) Replace existing API calls to cinder for attachment with new attachment API
calls

2) Add multiattach handling for glance cinder usecase

Alternatives
------------

Use cinder's image volume cache that will clone the first bootable volume created
from image and subsequent requests will result in cinder's clone operation instead
of downloading the image from glance.

Performance Impact
------------------

The current number of calls to cinder will be reduced resulting in performance
improvement. Example: initialize_connection and attach calls will be replaced
by attachment_update and similarly terminate_connection and detach calls will
be replaced by attachment_delete.
